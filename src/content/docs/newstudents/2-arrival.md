:::note
Typically, the Membership Director(s) of MaSA will assist incoming students with this entire process. 

In the rare circumstance we are unable to help, then this guide details what you should prioritize doing once you arrive and are settled in.

## Getting your Student ID

For latest details and opening times, see the [Illini Union Bookstore site](https://bookstore.illinois.edu/).

You'll have to [make your way](https://g.page/illiniunionbookstore?share) to the bookstore for your I-Card. There should be someone at the desk whom you may ask directions for. Let them know you want to get your I-Card.

The I-Card is necessary for gaining access to the residence hall you live in, for entering certain campus buildings, and scanning in for things like COVID tests or McKinley appointments.
It also acts as an ATM card, if you choose to associate your PNC bank account to it!

## Getting a Bank Account (PNC)

Luckily, this is also at the [Illini Union Bookstore](https://g.page/illiniunionbookstore?share)! Again, front desk can direct you if the location isn't so obvious on arrival. You'll be talking to someone in the PNC branch and they'll be helping you through the process of getting your account and debit card settled up.

:::caution
**You do not get your debit card immediately**. Rather, it will be mailed to the address you registered yourself under, around three days later.

Also **a phone number is required during that process.** Typically, since MaSA board members will be there with you, incoming students will use one of our phone numbers for the time being. As far as we can tell, this has been inconsequential. If you cannot have a MaSA member assisting you, then you may have to [get a data plan](#getting-a-data-plan) first.

## Getting a Data Plan

A phone number is very very important for getting around. So is mobile internet. **You should check if your phone supports mobile plans here; this tends not to be the case for Android-phone users, so you may have to purchase a new phone here**.

Plans are relatively cheap here, even at unlimited data, so we usually recommend getting unlimited data unless you want to cheap out and know you aren't going to use much every month. 

Usually, people tend to research their dataplan options once, stick to one dataplan, then never think about it ever again. Or, someone else did it for you and included you in the family plan for cheaper plans. 

Below are Afnan's recommendations:

#### Mint

> This in our experience has been the best, least-hassle, touchdown option for incoming students. You can order a simcard online for whatever duration you choose and they'll mail it to you, with an eject pin too.
>
> You can ask a MaSA board member to make this purchase for you (and you pay them back later) if you want it ASAP, since ordering online means requiring a debit/credit card (which unfortunately requires a phone number).

#### Cricket

> This is what I used. Unlimited data for $20 a month for a "family" of 4 or more.

#### Other

> I'm aware of the existence of T-Mobile & Verizon here as well. We're not sure what their processes are, nor their rates.

<!-- Wow, guess this one's no longer needed, huh? -->

## Getting tested for COVID

As of 2025 this probably isn't as urgent as it used to be. Once you have your I-Card, you can request a free COVID-19 testing kit from a residence hall or the Quad Shop in the Illini Union.
